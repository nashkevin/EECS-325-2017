There is one known issue with my part 3. Sometimes the o_to_r_rtt is off
by just a little bit. It usually isn't, and as far as I can tell, r_to_o_rtt
is always correct. I don't have time to investigate further, which sucks
because it's probably something small.

I have the default Makefile rule "make" set to compile everything.

Enjoy.
