-m is correct sometimes. That's all I know. It's 2:47 pm on the Saturday after
the due date, so I don't have time to dig deeper, but I feel like it's one or
two simple bugs throwing things off.

Everything else should work quickly and correctly.

I have it the default rule "make" set to compile everything.

Enjoy.
